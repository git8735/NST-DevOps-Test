Description:

1. Developer Writes Code & Raises PR:
  - Developer: Writes new code or modifies existing code in a feature branch.
  - Code Review: The developer raises a Pull Request (PR) to merge their changes into a target branch (e.g., develop or main). The PR is reviewed by peers for code quality, adherence to coding standards, and 
   potential issues.
2. Merge & Trigger Pipeline:
  - Merge PR: Once the PR is approved, it gets merged into the target branch.
    This merge action automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline configured for the project.
Pipeline Stages:
3. Install Tools:
  - Description: Set up the build environment with necessary tools.
  - Actions:
       - Use a script or configuration file (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to install tools like Java JDK, Node.js, Docker, Maven, etc.
       - Ensure version consistency across different environments.
4. Install Dependencies:
  - Description: Download and install all project dependencies.
  - Actions:
       - Use package managers such as npm for Node.js, pip for Python, or Maven for Java to install required libraries and frameworks.
       - Create a clean environment for each build to ensure no leftover dependencies affect the process.
5. Run Test Cases:
  - Description: Execute automated tests to validate the code.
  - Actions:
       - Unit Tests: Check individual components for correctness using frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, or Mocha.
       - Integration Tests: Validate interactions between components.
       - Code Coverage: Measure how much of the codebase is covered by tests.
6. Run SonarQube Analysis:
  - Description: Perform static code analysis for quality and security.
  - Actions:
       - Use SonarQube to scan the code for code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities.
       - Generate detailed reports and ensure the code meets defined quality gates.
7. Run Trivy File System Scan:
  - Description: Scan the file system for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
  - Actions:
       - Use Trivy to scan for known vulnerabilities in OS packages, application dependencies, and configuration files.
       - Review and address any identified issues before proceeding.
8. Build App:
  - Description: Compile the source code into a deployable artifact.
  - Actions:
       - Use build tools like Maven, Gradle, or npm to compile the code.
       - Generate artifacts such as JAR, WAR, or binary files.
9. Publish Artifacts to Nexus:
  - Description: Store the built artifacts in a repository manager.
  - Actions:
       - Upload artifacts to Nexus Repository Manager.
       - Version control the artifacts for traceability and rollback capabilities.
10. Build Docker Image:
  - Description: Package the application into a Docker image.
  - Actions:
       - Use a Dockerfile to define the environment and dependencies.
       - Build the Docker image and tag it with appropriate version numbers.
11. Scan Docker Image:
  - Description: Ensure the Docker image is secure and free of vulnerabilities.
  - Actions:
       - Use tools like Trivy, Clair, or Aqua Security to scan the Docker image.
       - Address any vulnerabilities before proceeding.
12. Deploy to Kubernetes:
  - Description: Deploy the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster
  - Actions:
       - Use Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to define the deployment.
       - Deploy the application to the cluster, managing pods, services, and ingress rules.
13. Functional Testing:
  - Description: Validate the applicationâ€™s functionality in the deployed environment.
  - Actions:
       - Use tools like Selenium, Postman, or Cucumber to run automated functional tests.
       - Ensure the application meets all functional requirements and behaves as expected.
14. Penetration Testing:
  - Description: Perform security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
  - Actions:
       - Use tools like OWASP ZAP to conduct penetration testing.
       - Identify and mitigate any security vulnerabilities found.
